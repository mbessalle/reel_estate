#### Rules for this assessment

- You are required to do your assessment individually.
- You are allowed to use any materials in the reader or on the internet.
- You either have to be able to explain your code or reference the source where you found it.
- If you found some code on the internet and used it, put a link in your `REFLECTION.md` to the stackoverflow post or documentation where you found it.
- You are NOT allowed to look at another student's code, or receive external help.
- As stated in the traineeship contract, if you plagiarise other student's work you will receive an invoice for the course: €280 for each day of the course.
- If your app does not run on `npm install && npm start` you will receive a 10 point penalty.
- If your app is pushed to a `public` repository you automatically fail this assessment.
- If you discuss the assessment in a slack channel / discord server you automatically fail this assessment.
- Do not make this assessment public in other ways like posting the briefing or deploying this app
- Do not make this assessment public at a later date (do not use it for your portfolio)

#### Second opinion

- As per CRBKO rules you can request a second opinion from another teacher if you disagree with your evaluation. To request reevaluation send an email to: teachers@codaisseur.com

#### Start time:

Tuesday May 26 18:00

#### Deadline:

Thursday 28 May 22:00

#### Passing grade:

45 / 60 points

#### Retry assessment granted at

- 30 / 60 points
- ~200 word reflection
- An accurate self assessment (within 7 points of the evaluator)

#### How to make and submit your homework

- Use `npx create-react-app` to create new react app
- Add this briefing to your local repo as `BRIEFING.md`
- `create-react-app` will initialize a git repository for you, so don't make one yourself
- Go to `github.com` and
  - create a new `private` repository
  - make sure **NOT** to initalize with a readme / .gitignore as it will give you errors when you will try to push
  - Add the evaluator to your repository as a `collaborator` (if you don't know who the evaluator will be: ask)
- Add your newly created git repository as a remote to your react app
- Push the initial version of your app created by `create-react-app`
- Start your react app with `npm run start`, as usual and start programming.
- You are allowed to leave `console.log`s and comments in your code, but please make your code reasonably indented/formatted, and remove unnecessary code. This will make your teachers happy :)
- Your teachers will also be happy if you make enough git commits. This way, we can see your progress. You get a point for committing at least once per section.

## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

- Creating components
- Composing components and passing them data via props
- Using `event listeners` and `event handlers`
- Designing and managing component local state with `useState` hook
- Using the `useEffect` hook to fetch data
- Using `react-router-dom` to make static and dynamic routes
- Lifting state to a parent component, and passing callback props to children
- Making controlled forms
- Mapping, filtering, finding & sorting arrays of objects
- Making an express server that serves JSON
- Using npm to install packages, run scripts and write your own npm scripts (e.g. npm run dev)
- Basic git usage, making commits, adding remote & pushing to master

If this sounds like a large list, it is, and it's because you've learned a tremendous amount of things these past week! Don't let it scare or overwhelm you though, you have seen all these things. Don't hesitate to use the reader, Google (Stackoverlow), or the documentation links we provide below.

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating homework experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp for a real estate agency office called `reel estate`. It has 4 main pages

- A homepage with buttons and language options
- A page where customers can book a viewing of a property
- A page where customers can view and filter listings
- A page about the real estate agents with contact details

In addition we build the JSON api using express so our listings / agents data can be requested from a server.

## Api

The data for this app is already available through an api. This way you can build your entire app without having to have a working api yourself.

Overview of the entire api

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/

Endpoints:

GET /agents

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/agents

GET /listings

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/listings

A JSON with all the data:

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/db

## Wireframe

You will be provided with a wireframe that shows an overview of the app along with this README

## Features

### 1. As a customer I want to be able to navigate to different pages so I can find the information I am looking for

- The app should have navigation on all pages so customers can easily find what they are looking for
- The pages `Home`, `Listings` and `Schedule viewing` are static Routes
- The page `About us` has a dynamic route, it contains a route parameter for `language`

| Criteria                                                                 | Points |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 3 Static Routes are implemented using react router                       | 1      |
| There is 1 dynamic route implemented with a route parameter for language | 1      |
| Each route renders a different component                                 | 1      |
| A navbar can be used to navigate on all pages                            | 1      |
| The navbar indicates what page you are on                                | 1      |
| Total                                                                    | 5      |

Hint: to indicate what page a user is on use the `<NavLink />` component

https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/NavLink.md

**Note:** If you are unable to implement routing in the app, you may put (render) the components for all the other features in App.js without using Routing at all.

### 2. As an International customer I want to be able to select my language, so I can understand where to go

- The home page has 2 buttons
  - See listings: should link to the listings page
  - About us: should link to the about us page
- The homepage has a `select` input where customer can choose between 4 languages: English, Dutch, German & Spanish
- When the page loads, the buttons should have English text
- When a user selects a language, the text on the two buttons changes to the correct translation
- The button `About us` links to the about us page, the path depends on the current language selected
- Using the navigation bar to go to the about page will navigate to /about/English path

| Language Selected | See listings       | About us       | path of link to about page |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| English           | See listings       | About us       | /about/English             |

| Spanish           | Venta propiedades  | Sobre nosotras | /about/Spanish             |

| Criteria                                                                           | Points |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 2 Buttons link to the correct pages                                                | 1      |
| A select input is displayed on the page, with 4 options for languages              | 1      |
| Selecting an option changes the text on the buttons                                | 1      |
| Translation of the buttons works correctly for all 4 languages                     | 1      |
| The `About us` button links to a different path depending on the language selected | 2      |
| Total                                                                              | 6      |

**Note:** Only the text of the buttons needs to be translated, other content on the page, e.g. title does not need to be translated

### 3. As a customer I want know who am I doing business with, so I can contact them

- There should be an `About us` page
- On the about page we display the real estate agents who work for `reel estate`
- There are two buttons linking to the `See Listings` and `Schedule viewing` pages
- Depending on which language a user has selected:
  - We only display agents that speak this language
  - The text of the button is translated into that language
- The data regarding the real estate agents is available through api

| path           | See listings       | Schedule a viewing     | agents        |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| /about/English | See listings       | Schedule a viewing     | Clemmy, Helga |
| /about/Dutch   | Bekijk woningen    | Bezichtiging aanvragen | Helga         |

| Criteria                                                                      | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Agents are displayed with their name, image, motto and email                  | 1      |
| The data for agents is fetched from the api, not hardcoded                    | 2      |
| Only agents that speak the language specified in the path are displayed       | 2      |
| Which agents to display is determined using Array.filter, not hardcoded       | 2      |
| The buttons link to the correct pages                                         | 1      |

**Note:** If you are unable to determine the for language in the path using the route parameter, hardcode a value for language and implement the behaviour that way

**Note:** Only the text of the buttons needs to be translated, other content on the page, e.g. title does not need to be translated

### 4. As a customer I want to be able to schedule a viewing, so I can see the property in real life before I buy it

- On our schedule a viewing page customers can fill in a form to schedule a viewing
- Once the form is submitted we want to give the user some confirmation everything went well
- We will not actually store the data, console.logging the data from the form to console is good enough for now
- The data for listings addresses is available through api

GET /listings

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/listings

| Criteria                                                                   | Points |

| The form has a select input for listing address, and a date input for date | 0.5    |
| The state of the form is controlled using React useState hook(s)           | 2      |
| When the form is submitted, the user input for all form fields is logged   | 2      |
| When the form has been submitted, we show a success message to the user    | 2      |
| The options for listing addresses are fetched from the api, not hardcoded  | 2      |
| The success message is an alert, prompt or confirm popup                   | -1     |
| There is a warning in the console regarding "key" props                    | -1     |
| Submitting the form refreshes the page                                     | -2     |
| Total                                                                      | 10     |

### 5. As a customer I want to be able to view and filter property listings, so I can find a property according to my needs

- We want to display the listings we have available with their details
- The listings are sorted by price from cheap to expensive
- In order to make it easy for users to find properties within their budget and space needs, there are 2 sliders for `budget` (refers to priceEuro in the listings) and `floor space` (refers to m2 in the listings).
- The value of the `budget` slider is the `maximum` budget for the user. We should filter out all listings that are more expensive than the value of the slider.
- The value of the `floor space` slider is the `minimum` floor space for this user. We should filter out all listings that have less m2 than the value of the slider.
- The minimum and maximum values for both sliders should depend on the data we have. For example, if the cheapest property 161000, the minimum value of the budget slider should be 161000. If the biggest appartment is 103 m2 the maximum value of the floor space slider should be 103.
- Ideally these minimum and maximum values are not hardcoded but depend on the data we have fetched from the api.

**Hint:** Make the sliders using `<input type="range">`, documentation on it can be found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range)

**Hint:** You might have to google how get minimum and maximum values using javascript

| Criteria                                                             | Points |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| The address, price, m2, bedRooms, is displayed for all listings      | 1      |
| The data for each listing is displayed using a seperate component    | 2      |
| The data is displayed using .map                                     | 1      |
| There is a warning in the console regarding "key" props              | -1     |
| Listings are sorted by priceEuro                                     | 1      |
| The data is fetched from the api, not hardcoded                      | 1      |
| There are 2 sliders, one for budget & one for floor space            | 1      |
| The slider for budget has a min and max value                        | 0.5    |
| The slider for floor space has a min and max value                   | 0.5    |
| Moving a slider for budget filters listings which are too expensive  | 2      |
| Moving a slider for floor space filters listings which are too small | 2      |
| The properties are filtered using something other than .filter       | -2     |
| The min and max values for the sliders are dynamic, not hardcoded    | 3      |
| Total                                                                | 15     |

### 6. Express server

- So far we've been using the api which is already online. We can also create this api ourselves using express.
- Your React can make use of the api which is already online, your React app does not have to fetch data from your own api.
- Your own express api should return the same data as the one that is already online.
- All api endpoints should respond with JSON (not HTML)
- The entire set of data from the api is available from the following api endpoint:

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/listings-agents-data/db

- We want to implement one extra route that is not part of the online api: `/agents/:language`, which responds which agents that speak that language

Example:

- request: http://localhost:4000/agents/Catalan
- response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Clemmy",
    "lastName": "Soulsby",

  }
]
```

- request: http://localhost:4000/agents/English
- response:
