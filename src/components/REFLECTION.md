I found this assessment to be incredibly challenging for just 2 weeks of practice. I found myself not being able to commit and comment things the way I would have desired due to the deadline pressure. Also, Something I would have liked to do better is the naming of my functions and variables. I tried to tackle the slide bar functionality and spent waaay too much time on it and it got me to the point where I have to write this assessment letter in much more of a hurry then I would have like to. Overall, it was an intense and stressful experience that I hope I pass and look forward to being challenged in the future as well. 

Thank you.

kind regards.
